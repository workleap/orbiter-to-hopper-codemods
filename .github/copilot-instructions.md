- When creating a PR:
  - Make sure to update the version in the `.codemodrc.json` file only if the logic has changed.
    - Just increment the minor version.
  - Make sure to update the `README.md` file with any new features or changes if there are alreay there.
    - No need to add new sections about new features or updates.
    - Just update the existing sections if it is required.
